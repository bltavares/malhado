## Description

Malhado is an Android application that allows you to import '.fit' files into the Android Health Connect application.

Useful to import data from Garmin/Magene/Xoss/iGPSPORT devices into the Android Health Connect application, so it can be synchronized with Google Fit and Samsung Health.


## Usage

File selector:

1. Download the '.fit' file from your device.
2. Open the Malhado application and select the '.fit' file.
3. Import the data if it is correct.


Share intent:

1. Share the '.fit' file with the Malhado application.
2. Import the data if it is correct.


## Support

This app is designed for my own needs (so far `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`), so it only parses:

- Cycling activities
- Single sport session
